## Description

This application prompts the user (via Windows Command Processor/Terminal) a series of questions, for which the respective answers will be used as parameters for generating a README.md file. Developing this application used the following technologies: Nodejs, Inquirer package, and the file system package. My biggest motivation for developing this application was in fact to learn more of the latter two aforementioned technologies. Another concept I explored during the development of this application was modularization. Namely, this occurs in the included ./utils/generateMarkdown.js file.
